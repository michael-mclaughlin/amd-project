AMD official mockup for the Ryzen7 chip world debut

This is the official mock that I did the UX, UI design, front-end development using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.  This was a parallax layout design with Video backgrounds.  At the time of completion Firefox had adopted a new video format compared to chrome, IE and Safari's mp4 called webm.  To bypass having to use the different formats when playing videos I created my own, hand coded jQuery video controls.
